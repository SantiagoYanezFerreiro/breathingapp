      <h2 className="text-section-heading">Regular Intervals</h2>
      <p className="text-section-content">
        The Regular Intervals program focuses on establishing a balanced
        breathing rhythm. It involves a structured pattern of inhaling, holding,
        and exhaling breaths at specific durations. This program helps regulate
        your breathing and promote a sense of calm and relaxation.

      <h2 className="text-section-heading">Box Breathing</h2>
      <p className="text-section-content">
        The Box Breathing program follows a simple and effective technique that
        involves equal durations for each phase of the breath: inhale, hold,
        exhale, and hold again. This method promotes deep relaxation, stress
        reduction, and mental clarity.

      <h2 className="text-section-heading">4-7-8 Program</h2>
      <p className="text-section-content">
        The 4-7-8 Program involves a specific breathing pattern of inhaling for
        4 seconds, holding the breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling slowly for 8
        seconds. This program is renowned for its calming effect on the nervous
        system, reducing anxiety and inducing a state of tranquility.

        The Breathing Hold program focuses on increasing breath control and lung
        capacity. It incorporates longer breath-holding durations during the
        inhale and exhale phases, allowing you to strengthen your respiratory
        system and improve your overall breathing efficiency.
